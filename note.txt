Dropbox Integration Trial Project:

 So basically this project follows the MVC architecture, though I didn't include model because it's not needed,
 - The App/ folder: This contains the every about the application logic and the view template
 - The Config Foldr: This folder doesn't do much, it holds the value of the default route when no path is specified, it also holds the value of the download folder
 - The download folder: When the download button is clicked, a file get created and the file gotten from dropbox api is written to the created file
 - The public folder: The folder houses the index.php file which is where everything begins
 - The src folder: This folder contains the core classes
 - The vendor folder houses the autoload.php file and composer folder, the folder is also where 3rd party packages resides
